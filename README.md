# dbpr_fl
a complete RESTful API for Florida's DBPR Real Estate Licensing records


# DBPR

Florida's real estate licensing authority is the [Department of Business and Professional Regulation](https://www2.myfloridalicense.com/real-estate-commission/public-records/), or "DBPR". This entity oversees the publicly available information about the status and details of all professional and business licenses issued by the State of Florida, including Real Estate agents, brokers, and accredited instructors. Information on an individual license is available [at a web interface](https://www.myfloridalicense.com/wl11.asp?mode=2&search=LicTyp&SID=&brd=&typ=) on their main website, but this doesn't allow one to evaluate multiple licensee's data at the same time. For this purpose, DBPR regularly (about 2-3 times a week on average) publishes a complete, current set of licensee data to a public server.

These files contain most of the information needed to create a truly useful API interface from the dataset, and also reveal a rich source of data we can leverage to create some more general functions and code snippets related to Florida place names, address formatting, and more.

# Goals and Objectives
We will use a combination of technologies to normalize and wrangle the dataset, but our stack will mostly consist of:
- üêç Python - for infrastructure and moving things around
- ü¶Ü DuckDB - for initial data introspection, storage, and conversion
- üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è Polars - for more complex transformations and analysis via Dataframes

### The initial goals are as follows:
- [ ] create `Python` to automate checking for new `csv` files and fetching every 24 hours (if new)
- [ ] create `Python`/`SQL` to ingest files to an initial reversible state with high fidelity and compression (Parquet?) and archive in long-term storage with date stamps for future reference
- [ ] *OR* establish an alternate "change log"-based storage schema(?)
- [x] identify columns containing repetitive data that can be enumerated/indexed for efficency
- [ ] create `SQL` for initializing an empty DB
- [ ] create `Python` for initializing an empty DB
- [ ] create `Python`/`SQL` for normalizing `csv` data into usable `JSON`
- [ ] create `SQL` for ingesting a normalized `JSON` package into an empty DB
- [ ] create `Python`/`Polars` for ingesting a normalized `JSON` package into an empty DB
- [ ] create `SQL`/`Python`/`Polars` for *update* of new `csv` files to a normalized `JSON` package
- [ ] create `SQL`/`Python`/`Polars` for ingesting a normalized `JSON` package into an existing DB
- [ ] create `Python` logging for all of the above for bugfixes and observability

# DBPR CSV Column Overview

Let's begin looking at the dataset. The DBPR dataset consists of 14 large `.csv` files available via public FTP at:
```
ftp://dbprftp.state.fl.us/pub/llweb/
```

The files are organized and labeled in that directory by region:
`RE_rgn1.csv`, `RE_rgn2.csv`, `RE_rgn3.csv` ... `RE_rgn14.csv`.  The files have varying row counts, with a total combined row count of about `~465,000` rows in all files as of `08-22-2024`
<br>

Each DBPR `.csv` licensee file is a headerless comma-separated value file with 23 columns in `ASCII` format. We will assign header labels in column order as follows:

```json
"board"
"board_name"
"licensee_name"
"dba_name"
"rank_code"
"address_1"
"address_2"
"address_3"
"city"
"state_code"
"zip_code"
"county_code"
"county_name"
"license_number"
"primary_status"
"secondary_status"
"original_license_date"
"status_effective_date"
"license_expiration_date"
"alternate_license_number"
"self_proprietors_name"
"employers_name"
"employers_license_number"
```

Below are brief descriptions of each column in the data set, what the values mean, how they relate to each other, and some of our initial strategies and assumptions related to potential storage and compression of the ingested data in its native state.
<br>

Note that we've decided to define all "native" values from the files as `string` values; while some fields (like `board`, as noted directly below) could reasonably be ingested/interpreted as `int` or some other type, little to no performance gain is made, and future errors in the csv files, if any, will be handled more consistently if we just treat everything as a `string` on-ingestion.
<br>

These column descriptions are identical across all 14 files, and are used interchangably as descriptors of the column in individual `csv` files, the value as we transform it, and as column labels in the `DuckDB SQL` schema for the whole DB. 


# Column List

## `board`
- is natively ALWAYS a string with the value `"25"`
- cannot be null.
- stored as a `GENERATED` value `25` of type `TINYINT`
```jsonc
// board example:
native value: "25"
db value: {25}  // generated value
```
<br>


## `board_name`
- is natively a string which always contains one of the enumerated values.
- cannot be null.
- is stored as a `BIGINT` enumerated/mapped as follows:
```jsonc
// board_name example:
native value: "2501 Real Estate Broker or Sales"
db value: 2501
```
üóíÔ∏èNote: To get the original string for `board_name`, we combine the stored `BIGINT` and the corresponding string value
<br>
<br>


## `licensee_name`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `64` characters. 
- cannot be null.
- stored as a `VARCHAR` with a limit of `64` characters.
```jsonc
// licensee_name example:
native value: "Joe Smith"
db value: "Joe Smith"
```
<br>


## `dba_name`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `64` characters. 
- can be null.
- stored as a `VARCHAR` with a limit of `64` characters. 
```jsonc
// dba_name example:
native value: "Joe Smith Realty, Inc"
db value: "Joe Smith Realty, Inc"
```
<br>


## `rank_code`
- is natively a string which always contains exactly one of the enumerated values.
- NOT labeled `rank` intentionally; using `rank_code` prevents collisions with `SQL` verbs.
- can be used as a proxy to enumerate/construct several other column values
- map value to an `id` key as follows, where the native csv string value is mapped to `"rank"`
- stored as `TINYINT` by its `id` in the database.
- TODO: change internal labels!
```jsonc
// rank_code example:
native value: "SL Sales Associate"
db value: 6
```
üóíÔ∏èNote: The original `csv` string value is stored as `rank_code.rank`
<br>
<br>


## `address_1`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `48` characters. 
- cannot be null.
- stored as a `VARCHAR` with a limit of `64` characters.
```jsonc
// address_1 example:
native value: "123 Elm ST"
db value: "123 Elm ST"
```
<br>


## `address_2`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `40` characters.
- can be null.
- stored as a `VARCHAR` with a limit of `64` characters.
```jsonc
// address_2 example:
native value: "123 Elm ST"
db value: "123 Elm ST"
```
<br>


## `address_3`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `40` characters.
- can be null and blank values are nullable.
- stored as a `VARCHAR` with a limit of `64` characters.
```jsonc
// address_3 example:
native value: "123 Elm ST"
db value: "123 Elm ST"
```
<br>


## `city`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `24` characters.
- cannot be null TODO: (?)
- stored as a `VARCHAR` with a limit of `64` characters.
- TODO: presents opportunity for enumeration? only ~32k unique values in-db including misspellings
```jsonc
// city example:
native value: "Miami"
db value: "Miami"
```
<br>


## `state_code`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `2` characters.
- cannot be null TODO: (confirm?)
- NOT labeled `state` intentionally; using `state_code` prevents collisions with `SQL` verbs.
- is enumberable as a JSON struct value mapped to the value passed, which we can enhance at very little cost to be more useful by storing proper State strings mapped to values as shown; this lets us retrieve the abbreveiation OR the longform string for the `state_code` column.
```jsonc
// state_code example:
native value: "FL"
db value: "FL"
```
<br>


## `zip_code`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `10` characters.
- NOT labeled `zip` intentionally; using `zip_code` prevents collisions with `SQL` and `Python` verbs
- should only contain numbers and (possibly) a dash `-`, either: `12345` or `12345-7890`
- cannot be null TODO: (confirm?)
- stored as a `VARCHAR` with a limit of `10` characters.
- TODO: presents enumeration opportunity related to `city`
```jsonc
// zip_code example:
native value: "12345-7890"
db value: "12345-7890"
```
<br>


## `county_code`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `3` characters.
- should only contain numbers
- cannot be null TODO: (?)
- stored as `BIGINT`
- enumerated as follows: the `county_code` is in a single list, and the `county_name` is the key that refers to the list containg that `county_code` as a value.
```jsonc
// county_code example:
native value: "702"
db value: 702
```
<br>


## `county_name`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `16` characters.
- cannot be null TODO: (?)
- is stored as an enumerated (generated?) `VARCHAR` value mapped to the value of `county_code`
- see "Enumeration for `county_name` and `county_code` mapping" in `county_code` above
```jsonc
// county_name example:
native value: "Alachua"
db value: {row.county_code.name}  // generated value
```
<br>


## `license_number`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `7` characters.
- should only contain numbers
- is a unique identifier within the native csv data TODO: caveats?
- stored as an `INTEGER` with up to 7 digits
```jsonc

db value: 1234567
```
<br>


## `primary_status`

- stored as an enumerable with one of the following string values: 
```jsonc
// primary_status example:
native value: "Current"
db value: {Current}
```
<br>


## `secondary_status`
- is natively a string or `null` which always contains exactly one of the enumerated values.
- stored as a `BOOLEAN` where `"Active" == True` and `"Inactive" == False`, `null` is also valid 
```jsonc
// secondary_status example:
native value: "Active"
db value: true
```
<br>


## `original_license_date`
- is natively a string which always contains a date in `'%m/%d/%Y'` format
- stored as a `DATE` ingested via `'%m/%d/%Y'` format
```jsonc
// original_license_date example:
native value: "01/01/2010"
db value: {duckdb.date("01/01/2010", "%m/%d/%Y")}  // uses DuckDB DATE
```
<br>


## `status_effective_date`
- is natively a string which always contains a date in `'%m/%d/%Y'` format
- stored as a `DATE` in `'%m/%d/%Y'` format
```jsonc
// status_effective_date example:
native value: "01/01/2010"

```
<br>


## `alternate_license_number`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `9` characters which always contains a prefix and the `license_number`
- if we refer to the `rank_code` field and note the `"alt_lic_prefix"` value in that structure, the `alternate_license_number` value is a `VARCHAR` with a limit of 9 characters which is generated by combining the string values for `rank.alt_lic_prefix` and `license_number` to get something like: `"SL1234567"`
```jsonc
// alternate_license_number example:
native value: "SL1234567"
db value: {get_alt_lic_num("license_number", "rank_code")}  // generated value
```
<br>


## `self_proprietors_name`
- is natively a string with an observed limit of `64` characters. 
- can be null.
- stored as a `VARCHAR` with a limit of `64` characters.
